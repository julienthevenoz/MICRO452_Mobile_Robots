    "A small but determined vessel navigating uncharted waters, its sights set on a glittering treasure at the far edge of the map. Along the way, it must skillfully avoid perilous islands and evade the watchful patrols of navy ships.\n",

    "In this project, we implement global and local navigation for the Thymio robot. The goal is to enable the robot to plot an optimal course toward its destination while dynamically avoiding both static and unexpected obstacles. The key features of our implementation include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accurate map creation and feature localization using ArUco markers\n",
    "- Global pathfinding using Dijkstra's algorithm\n",
    "- Seamless connection to the Thymio robot for real-time path execution\n",
    "- Path-following with dynamic adjustment for precision navigation\n",
    "- Emergency handling, including \"Thymio kidnapping\" detection and recovery\n",
    "- Local obstacle avoidance with a potential field method\n",
    "- Robust navigation supported by a Kalman filter in the absence of camera input\n",

A getter function of Vision will then be used to access these values and pass them on to the other modules.\n",

They are part of a very convenient library which implements most of the code needed to detect the markers and the according translation and rotation transform matrices.\n",
