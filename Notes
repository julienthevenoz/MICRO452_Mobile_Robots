Notes for everyone :

QUESTION FOR EVERYONE [by Julien]: Where is the code run ? Is all the code loaded on the Thymio, and the computer sends the camera feed to the thymio, which filters, extracts the edges, computes the map, etc ? Or does the computer do 
                                  and send a list of coordinates for all the edges, the thymio position, etc ? Same question for the navigation, etc

Notes about vision:

Vision returns: (do you prefer numpy arrays)
 Thymio_Position (x,y,theta) a tuple 
 Goal position (x,y) a tuple 
 Corners_list : list of obstacles (defined by X corners) = list of tuples = [(obs1_corner1, obs1_corner2, obs1_corner3, obs1_corner4), 
                                                                             (obs2_corner1, obs2_corner2, obs2_corner3),
                                                                             (obs3_corner1, obs3_corner2, obs3_corner3, obs3_corner4)]


Notes about Navigation:

Notes about Filtering:

Notes about Motion Control:
To go from Thymio speed to mm/s, the conversion factor = 0.41666666666666663
The speed variance in mm^2/s^2 = 79.04287646849414
The speed state variance in mm^2/s^2 = 39.52
The speed measurement variance in mm^2/s^2 = 39.52




Personnal Reminders and notes
[Julien] I took lines X to Y of file vision.py from this source : blablaa.com
[Julien] I like trains



GIT :
To change branch (for example go to branch aruco_zhuoran)
  git checkout aruco_zhuoran
To get all the updates on the CLOUD/REMOTE git folder onto your own LOCAL git folder (do this regularly)
  git pull

To add the changes you just did to a file (first save the file lol):
     git add name_of_file.py
Then you can say to git "I'm sure I want to keep the changes on my own LOCAL GIT FOLDER" and add little messsage to remind yourself of what the changes were
    git commit -m "hello, this is a comment, I can write anything here"
Then when you want the others of the group to be able to see your changes, you can put them on the CLOUD/REMOTE git folder with
    git push
