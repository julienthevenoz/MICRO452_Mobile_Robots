Notes for everyone :

QUESTION FOR EVERYONE [by Julien]: Where is the code run ? Is all the code loaded on the Thymio, and the computer sends the camera feed to the thymio, which filters, extracts the edges, computes the map, etc ? Or does the computer do 
                                  and send a list of coordinates for all the edges, the thymio position, etc ? Same question for the navigation, etc

Notes about vision:

Vision returns: (do you prefer numpy arrays)
 Thymio_Position (x,y,theta) a tuple 
 Goal position (x,y) a tuple 
 Corners_list : list of obstacles (defined by X corners) = list of tuples = [(obs1_corner1, obs1_corner2, obs1_corner3, obs1_corner4), 
                                                                             (obs2_corner1, obs2_corner2, obs2_corner3),
                                                                             (obs3_corner1, obs3_corner2, obs3_corner3, obs3_corner4)]
